Today my youngest brother <a href="https://twitter.com/gshellen">Grant</a> and his wife <a href="https://twitter.com/hshellen">Heather</a> welcomed a beautiful baby boy to the world. Meet Charles Andersen Shellen. You can call him Charlie. I know this photo isn't my best look but I may have shed a tear or two holding my baby bro's baby.
