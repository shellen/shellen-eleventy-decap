Tonight while looking for my personal blog post about the sale of Thing Labs to AOL I realized... I never posted it. There it sat in the drafts on Blogger. I must have been a little busy that day. In any case, I just back-dated it and posted it like it was a page ripped from one notebook and Scotch-taped back in where it belonged. All is right with the world.
