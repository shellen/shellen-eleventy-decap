<p>If you are reading this in a feed reader then you are probably subscribed to my Feedburner-ized feed of shellen dot com, which is cool, but as of today I decided to stop blending in my Flickr photos. I still like Flickr, I still take photos <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shellen/4249640495/">like this recent one of my old Sony Sports Walkman</a>, but it's mucking up some other things l've been using like <a href="https://friendfeed.com/shellen">Friendfeed</a> and <a href="https://shellen.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> with duplicate posts. If you still want to subscribe to my photos you can add this <a href="https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=34427465855@N01&lang=en-us&format=rss_200">link to my Flickr stream</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/ig/addtoreader?et=4b44c416fFTGyBsE&source=atgs&feedurl=https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne%3Fid%3D34427465855%40N01%26lang%3Den-us%26format%3Drss_20&feedtitle=Uploads+from+jasonshellen&url=https://www.google.com/ig/add%3Fsource%3Datgs%26feedurl%3Dhttp%253A//api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne%253Fid%253D34427465855%40N01%2526lang%253Den-us%2526format%253Drss_20">use this link if you use Google Reader</a>. Thanks!</p>
