title: Thing Labs joins AOL
---

I'm incredibly happy to share with you today that my company Thing Labs is merging with AOL. Thing Labs has come a long way in the last two years, and we've built products I love and a team I'm proud to work with daily. AOL has recognized this, and we agree that there are a lot of great things we can do together. My collaborator and business partner Chris Wetherell and I will be heading up product development for AIM, Lifestream and other consumer products. Don't worry: <a href="https://brizzly.com">Brizzly</a> will live on.

I want to thank those who had a hand in making this deal happen, and my team at Thing Labs for building great products and just generally being great people. For more information about what the future holds, see our post about the merger on [the Thing Labs blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20100930151108/https://blog.thinglabs.com/post/1205976398/thing-labs-merging-with-aol "the Thing Labs blog") or check out the [announcement from AOL](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100928007205/en/AOL-Acquires-Social-Software-Start-Up-Thing-Labs "announcement from AOL").
