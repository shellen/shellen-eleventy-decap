I took this photo outside our house the other day. This photo is also part of a test I'm doing. I uploaded the photo here with Picasa for Mac's BlogThis plug-in but I also uploaded it to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shellen/4235387457/">Flickr</a> and <a href="https://brizzly.com/pic/XFM/index.html">Brizzly</a>. So far, Brizzly is the easiest upload but I suspect that the compression used will make the photo look best on Flickr. I'll keep you posted on the results.
